### How to run the algorithm
To run the algorithm problems it is pretty simple, in your terminal:

```shell
node {relative path of the file you want to run} # The answer print out in your terminal
```

### How to run tests
To check if the algorithms are working correctly, we can just manually change the keys or values in the object in `deepEqual.js` or the elements in `sync.js`
