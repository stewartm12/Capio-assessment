### How to run tests
- 1st Option: To check if the algorithms are working correctly, we can just manually change the keys or values in the object in `deepEqual.js` or the elements in `sync.js`, and then run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
node {relative path of the file you want to run} # The answer print out in your terminal
```

- 2nd Option: Open the index.html in the browser and the mocha test will be able to run. All tests in mocha are passing and you can change the values in the tests to your desire.
